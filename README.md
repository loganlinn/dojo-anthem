# dojo-anthem

Code from [Jan 2013's SF Clojure Dojo
Meet-up](http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/91024502/) from Group 5.

This was our crack at using [Overtone](http://overtone.github.com/) to
play a national anthem. It was the first time any of us had seen the
library or programmed music. It's really not much, but we were able to
make something!

## Usage

```
lein run -m dojo-anthem.group5.core
```
